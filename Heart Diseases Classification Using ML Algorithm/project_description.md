                        HEART DISEASES CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING 

A machine learning project focused on classifying heart diseases involves machine learning algorithm 
and data analysis skills to train model using predefined data that can predict or classify different 
diseases based on symptoms.

Machine Learning Algorithm Used

1.Logistic Regression

2.Support Vector Machine

3.K Nearest Neighbour(KNN)

4.Confusion Matrix

With the help of heart dataset which is having chest Xray images for various symptoms of heart diseases
model is being prepared and trained. 
Using exploratory data analysis complete data is preprocessed and normalized which removes noise 
and inappropriate data.
